Symbolic Derivation of TOV equations and Curvature Scalars with SageMath

Einstein Equations, Curvature scalars and TOV equations are solved for a perfect dust stress-energy tensor in schwarzschild metric.
curvature scalars & tov.ipynb is the block oc codes generated by JupyterLab. You can use this to inspect the code.
